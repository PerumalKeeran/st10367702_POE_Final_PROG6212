About cmcs
The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a web application developed with ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server. The system aims to simplify the monthly claim process for Independent Contractor lecturers through automated calculations, organization of supporting documents, and a defined approval workflow. Instructors may submit claims along with documentation, Coordinators and Managers carry out distinct approval phases, and HR can view the finally approved claims and utilize CSV export features. The application guarantees precision, clarity, and effectiveness throughout the entire claim-handling process

Summary of Lecturer Feedback 
Throughout the development process, feedback from lecturers emphasized the necessity for two main improvements: (1) lecturers should be able to monitor the status of their submitted claims, and (2) the Coordinator and Manager require distinct approval perspectives, as both positions independently assess every claim. Both requirements were successfully implemented: a dedicated “My Claims” page now enables lecturers to check real-time statuses for all their submissions, while the workflow was enhanced to feature separate Coordinator and Manager dashboards with unique approval logic and status transitions. These enhancements reinforced the workflow logic of the system and matched the final solution with actual institutional procedures.
